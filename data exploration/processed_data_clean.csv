In addition to extending the deadline, please have your finance department deduct the order from the above mentioned grant. The computer automatically deducted it from our next MOCO grant which expires in June.

Good morning Partners, 
 
 We hope this message finds you well. Today, February 12th 2025, the Capital Area Food Bank is operating solely in an administrative capacity, and there will be no deliveries or pickups due to the current weather conditions. 
 
 For partners who have orders scheduled for tomorrow or Friday, we plan to operate under normal conditions. However, if you anticipate that your agency will be closed due to the weather, please reach out to Customer Relations as soon as possible to discuss rescheduling your order at partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org or 202-644-9845. 
 
 Additionally, even if your site remains open, we require confirmation that your location has been safely plowed and salted to allow for safe deliveries. If a driver arrives at your site and finds it is not adequately prepared, please be aware that your agency may incur a restocking fee. Our delivery equipment cannot navigate through snow or ice safely, and we prioritize the safety of both our drivers and your staff. 
 
 We appreciate your cooperation and understanding as we work together to ensure everyone's safety during this weather event. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated with any changes regarding our operations for the rest of the week.
 
 Thank you for your partnership. Stay safe and warm!
 
 Best regards,

On June 7th, the Capital Area Food Bank will be closing early. Only the 8am-10am delivery and 8am, 9am, and 10am pickup slots will be available. This will also affect the puller's schedule on Monday, June 10th, resulting in limited delivery and pickup windows.

I did not see on the home page about Juneteenth, but I am assuming that is why the order is closed now. Can we make an adjustment? Can you remove the:

 

825043 Mangos CASE 10lbs 1/10 lbs Case (x 20 cases)

 

We realized late that we put a pallet (want to keep) in as well. 

 

Thanks{color}

[CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the organization. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe]   

Good morning, Partners, 


 We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. 

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations.  *We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it.*  Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( *5 pm*) on  *January 7th*, or the order will be canceled on our end. 


 Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further!
 We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time.

One of a few things could be happening. \n\n1.) If you are in editing mode, which means you clicked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Edit Order\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and you are viewing your card- there will be error messages saying that there are zero availability because there is no more left of that item to add to your order. Whatever you had on your order before starting to edit the order is secured but the error message is saying that there is no more of this item available to add more of. \n\n2.) If you did not hit save, which I see that you said you did- then you could have lost of the items. Previously, the old system held in the carts for 24 hours, but that is no longer the case. \n\n3.) The last instance is that throughout the day, our warehouse team members are continuously doing quality checks. If for any reason produce fails that quality check or the warehouse team deems it as not being able to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmake it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (quality wise) to the date it's supposed to be delivered it can be taken off of your order. \n\nI am looking at your order and I do see eggplant, potatoes, cucumbers and squash on your orders. \n\n\""D\"" "", ""comment2"": ""06/13/2023 02:11;qm:65d20c5a-0c84-458e-8ce1-adb90d07460f:aee87fd4-4f18-41ae-8ac7-c8413d38748c;Ok thanks so much for explaining.

I am confused regarding the shopping process.

These items were placed and saved in our cart a little over 2 weeks ago. So please help me to understand how this happens, and more so without the offer of a replacement. _x000D_

Once you complete the checkout process, your items are put on a sales order and finalized.

Hi Alanna and Sharon, 

  

Greetings. We continue to appreciate the product received from the Produce Hub. Just FYI, we did discard a couple boxes of cantaloupes and some potatoes from the delivery yesterday.

Good Evening Partners,

We would like to inform you that the Capital Area Food Bank will be closed on Tuesday, January 7th, 2025, due to inclement weather. On this day, there will be no pickups or deliveries, and any scheduled orders will be rescheduled once we reopen.

Please note that Customer Relations will also be closed on that day. All tickets and phone calls will be addressed upon our reopening when we will process rescheduling and cancellations. We will provide an update regarding our status for Wednesday later on Tuesday.

Stay safe and warm.

Thank you,

When a product is labeled as \""assorted,\"" it means it is a compilation of dozens of different products under that category that have been donated.

Additionally, we recommend using your knowledge of food safety and your senses (sight, smell, and texture) to determine if the food is in good condition.\n\nI apologize for not being able to provide further guidance on this matter.

I have reviewed your reported issues and consulted with my colleagues in our Food Resources and Operations Teams.\n\nRegarding the tortillas, I apologize that they were sent out after their expiration date. I have reported this to the Food Resources Team for further investigation. However, since you received them, I have processed a credit of $45.60 for the tortillas you ordered (which had a discount applied). This credit will be applied to the invoice associated with your order, Invoice #180569.\n\nAs for the flavored water, the date on the items indicated \""BB,\"" which stands for \""best by.\"" Many of our donated foods may be past their best by or sell by dates. These dates are intended to inform you of when the item is not at its peak quality, not about food safety. The items are still safe to consume, and we encourage our partners to use their judgment.

Hi Laura,  

  

I hope this email finds you well.  

  

I am sending the July report. Also, I wanted to let you know that Blake wonâ€™t be able to pick up the order he placed. He is in this moment at the hospital.  

  

Let me know if you have any questions,

Good morning, Partners, 


 We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. 

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations.  *We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it.*  Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( *5 pm*) on  *January 7th*, or the order will be canceled on our end. 


 Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further!
 We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time. Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this situation together. We are working quickly to get back on schedule.

{color:#172B4D} Hello Alanna,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} This is Than from BPSOS. I am writing this to let you know about an issue with our food delivery this morning 11/15.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} We ordered a total of 8 or 9 pallets of vegetables this morning. However, those pallets were stacked on top of each other as a pair when they were delivered. We asked the driver if he could bring the pallets down since they are very heavy (about 800 lbs each) and our office did not have any equipment to handle that. He said that there was nothing he could do because they were loaded into the truck like that.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} We did have this issue in the past and it took our staff (which comprised of many seniors) a tremendous amount of effort to handle it. We always appreciate CAFB for providing the food for free, but in the future, it would be great if you do not stack pallets on top of each other. If you have no choice but to do so, please let us know in advance.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

For now, please relay the message below to the partner: \n\n_Good afternoon- The Customer Relations Team has reported your concerns to our Senior Managers in Operations, and they are committed to helping our partners address these challenges.

I will keep you updated on any developments. I want to assure you that your feedback has been heard and is being taken into consideration.   The reason for the current packing method is due to truck capacity. If the pallets are not stacked, they will take up more space in the truck and could potentially require multiple trucks for delivery. Our drivers carry pallet jacks with them on their routes, but they do not have reach machines like those used in the warehouse to pull orders and unstack items.  We are working on this, and I apologize for the challenges it presents.

{color:#172B4D} Hello Alanna,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} Happy Monday! This is Than from BPSOS. I am writing this because we encountered a technical issue on the website. Last Friday 11/22, we tried to add a few items, namely 2 of the  *800908 Cabbage, Green Local 675# BIN 1/675 lbs Bin* into our cart, to be delivered this Wednesday 11/27. However, it said that those items were not available on that selected date, but in the item description, it said that it will still be available until 12/10. As a result, we could not select those items back then. It was pretty late then, so I was not able to email you until today.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} I know that we may past the deadline for edit order; however, is it possible for you to remove all of the ""300597 Turkey Breast, 6-9# Basted w/ Gravy Packet 1/30.42486 lbs Case"" from our cart, and replace them with 2 of the ""800908 Cabbage, Green Local 675# BIN 1/675 lbs Bin?""

Karen informed me a few minutes ago that Bull Runâ€™s order for today SO186597 was not delivered because we only had 2 drivers in Virginia to make deliveries. Karen has confirmed with the partner that they can accept the delivery tomorrow morning. I have moved the appointment to tomorrow in NetSuite so that it can be routed with tomorrowâ€™s orders. I will also send an outlook invitation out as a reminder. I wanted to let you all know as well so we can ensure that the issue is properly tracked.  

  

Please let me know if further information is needed at this time. Thank you!

My apologies that I did not attend the mandatory training for updating the hours on Partner link. 

I did not realize that there was a training (not sure if I missed an email). 

I see that the deadline to update the hours is Oct. 1. 

Is there some written instructions that I could follow or can I set up a time to get a quick training? 

Again, my apologies for missing this. 

  

Thanks,

CCF Produce Hub Issue ,PART1-7904,74210,[System] Service request,Closed,PART1,Partner Support,Medium,Done,DH,crrarF aareeG,rcFraeer raGa,2024-11-21 12:08:00,2024-11-29 01:31:00,,2024-11-25 02:40:00,,"{color:#172B4D}Good afternoon,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} I wanted to follow up with you all regarding the issue with Capital Christian Fellowship's produce hub earlier this week. CCF adds food and edits the SO I make for their produce hubs. In the past few months, they have added thousands of pounds of food to these orders, making them close to 40k pounds sometimes. For the most recent hub order, someone at CCF accidentally removed 3k pounds of produce meant for the produce hub. Christ let me know that this can happen since the produce is marked as available for agencies and CAFB staff.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} We are having a meeting tomorrow with CCF to discuss the produce hub orders. I wanted to reach out to you all to get your insight on whether it would be beneficial for Transportation/Ops if I told CCF  that  *they cannot add/modify*  produce hub SOs anymore. However, I wouldn't want CCF to create additional orders during the same time and further strain the capacity of Transportation/Ops. If there is a specific pound limit that I should tell them not to exceed when adding food to the produce hub SOs, I can do that as well.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   
  
{color:#172B4D} I know that the produce limitations will impact their ordering, so their order sizes will probably decrease in the next few months. Please let me know if there is anything you would like me to mention during the meeting tomorrow. Thank you again for all your help!{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

I wanted to bring this matter to Austin and discuss it with her. I understand the implications of the large orders and the concerns surrounding the removal of produce for the produce hub. When I spoke to Austin, she suggested that the first step should be to have a conversation with the partner to explain the implications of their edits to the order. They need to be mindful that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to lose their produce items meant for the hub and that they should be aware of the weight of their orders when placing them.  \n\nHere are two key points I discussed with Austin:  \n\n1. Currently, we do not have a formal limit for orders, so we cannot tell them what a limit would be. Operations and ERP/IT are working on measures to ensure that for large orders, the number of delivery blocks corresponds appropriately. For example, two weeks ago, Capital Christian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s order required five trucks for delivery but only occupied one slot, which is unrealistic. For now, we can only ensure that Operations is aware and prepared for these situations.\n\n 2. Austin mentioned that if this situation continues to cause recurring issues and impacts the produce hub's participating sites\u00e2\u20ac\u201dresulting in a loss of produce\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe can consider locking their orders for the produce hubs and requesting that they create a separate order. However, this could complicate matters since Operations has asked us to consolidate orders for the same partner to avoid having one sales order versus two. We can explore this locking option as a last resort if recurring issues continue. \n\n I hope this clarifies the situation, and please let me know if you need any assistance in engaging with the partner. \n\n Best,  \n\n \""D\""""}",,0.0

I hope your week is off to a good start!
It is Capital Christian Fellowship. We have to cancel our orders SO176185 (for Tuesday, September 24) and SO176188 (for Wednesday, September 25) because we have a repair to our Parking lot that needs to be fixed and we cannot receive any delivery!
Is it possible to carry over the items from SO176185 to our order for Tuesday, October 1 (SO177213) and the one from SO176188 to our order for Wednesday, October 2 (SO177245).
If this is possible, it would be so great!
I look forward to your response!

Thank you in advance!

I would also like to inform you that among the beans, we found a large number of severely dented canned beans that we had to throw away since we cannot offer them to our guests.

  *Subject:* Produce Hub Request  

   

Hi Augusta,
 
 I hope my email finds you well.
 
 I have a request about the Produce Hub: is it possible that the pallets of produce are not stacked on top of each other? SEED comes with a truck like the one from CAFB so it uses the pallet jack to pick up their produce but when the pallets are stacked on top of each other, we have no way to lower the pallet of produce which is on top which we forced to cut the cardboard, to extract the product into a bin so that another partner can have its product. If the pallets come individually, each organization has the possibility of collecting its pallet of produce to its truck.  

    

Also I looked at the order for the Hub but I only saw 50 squash boxes instead of 176 (the 58 boxes are the ones I ordered for my distribution). Will the rest be added later?   

    

Thank you Augusta

REQUEST ABOUT THE PRODUCE ALLOCATION LIMIT ,PART1-7780,72959,[System] Service request,Closed,PART1,Partner Support,Medium,Done,DH,ntrpcdm@aaiht.ehasirriooacliag,ittaedianorcrshhmcagpaaii.lr@o,2024-11-07 11:22:00,2024-11-13 01:30:00,,2024-11-07 11:29:00,,"Good morning CAFB team,

I hope my email finds you well. The form to make the request is no longer available which is why I am sending you this email.


CAFB has given our Food pantry a limit of 16,250 pounds per month but we would be grateful if we could have a very higher produce allocation otherwise our distribution will be in trouble. The first reason is that each week we have over 500 guests at our Food distribution (several times we have already exceeded 600 guests!) and the number is only increasing. We have 4 distributions in a month. 16,250 pounds per month is 8 pallets per month. We cannot feed more than 500 people per week with only 8 pallets per month so we will be forced to reduce our distribution to 1 day per month instead of 4 per month. 8 pallets is the minimum number of pallets of food we use for a single distribution in the month. If you look at our order history, for the past several months we have been doing 2 orders per week, one on Tuesday and one on Wednesday in order to have enough produce for all the families that come. 

The second reason is that CAFB is our only food supplier. If you maintain the limit of 16,250 pounds per month, the question for us will be: how are we going to get the difference in food that we will no longer have? Having no other suppliers, the only solution will still be to reduce the distribution days. 

The third reason is that we do not make our choices based on the pound because we have the space in our Gym to store at least 40 pallets against the wall, if they are pallets stored one on top of the other, that makes us more than 80 and we can also store 12 pallets in our Food pantry room so we have plenty of space to store the food. We make our choices taking into account the diversity of food because of the diversity of cultures who come to take the food. 

I hope that all these explanations will make us find favor in your eyes so that you increase our pound limit.


Thank you in advance.

Be blessed!

I hope your weekend went well and that your week is off to a wonderful start. Thank you again for all your hard work!
It is Capital Christian Fellowship. We have a request: we are supposed to have a delivery on Monday September 16th (SO174582) and Tuesday September 17th (SO173733/delivery hub). Is it possible that the items ordered for Monday will be added and delivered on Tuesday 17 and that the Monday 16 delivery will be cancelled? 

Thank you in advance for your reply.

I hope my email finds you well!

I sent you yesterday an email about a message that appears on your site while placing orders but I did not receive an answer yet. 
The message says â€œYou are required to verify all your hours of operation records before 10/1/2024 or your account will be locked.â€
What hours of operation must be recorded? I don't really understand this message.

Thank you in advance for the explanation.


Also in our October 1st order (SO176185), there is item 100773 Good Culture Probiotic Whole Milk which needs to be refrigerated. Is it possible for it to be delivered with our other orders on Wednesday, which is our distribution day? This will save us the storage problem.

Hope you had a great Thanksgiving!

We have a concern about the milk that will be delivered to us on Wednesday, December 4 (SO184675). Is it possible that for this time, the amount will be reduced to  *80 cases* instead of 108. 
The reason is that at our last milk distribution, we noticed that our guests were very careful about the best by/expiration date and we had milk that was left over. This was not a problem at that time because we were able to keep them in the refrigerator until the following food distribution.
But, we have the same leftover milk, we do not have enough space in the refrigerator at the moment to keep them and we do not want to waste food. This is why we want to be careful.

Inquiry Regarding $75 Delivery Charge for Invoice 171178 ,PART1-7274,67025,[System] Service request,Closed,PART1,Partner Support,Medium,Done,DH,AnrrC-oslnnyi uWtge,rgCsni o-yunrlnteAW,2024-08-28 02:07:00,2024-09-04 01:31:00,,2024-08-29 07:33:00,,"Hello, 

I just spoke with Ms. Burks about the $75 delivery charge on invoice 171178. Her entire order consisted of free produce. Although a grant wasn't used, all items, except the cantaloupe, were categorized as MD TEFAP. 

Could you please review and confirm whether the cantaloupe was placed in the correct category and if the delivery fee is accurate? If the charge is valid, would it be possible to reach out to Austin to inquire about waiving the fee? Following that, could we update Ms. Burks on the outcome? 

Unfortunately, Friday is my last day before maternity leave, so I won't be able to handle the follow-up myself. 

Thank you for your assistance. 

   

 Thank you,  

 Angel

I also realize that in previous years, there was a fee associated with our donated turkeys (0.19 cents per pound). However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pleased to share that this fee has been waived for this fiscal year, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible you may have paid in the past but you would not have to this time for the donated product. \n\n  \n\nI genuinely want to ensure that you and your clients receive the support you need this holiday season. I understand how quickly these items can disappear from the menu, and I encourage you to check it daily, as we frequently add new products. Right now, we also have vegetable oil, stuffing mix, corn muffin mix, canned collard greens, and beans that might help supplement your holiday distributions. \n\n  \n\nPlease feel free to check the menu regularly, and if I see any additional turkeys come available, I will reach out to you. \n\n  \n\nThank you for your understanding, and know that we are here to support you and your community during this important time. \n\n  \n\nWarm regards,  \n\n\""D\""{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n  \n\n!image001.png|thumbnail!{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n *{color:#4E8227} *DH*{color}*{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n{color:#4E8227}Manager of Customer Relations & Distribution Network Evolution{color}{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n {color:#4E8227}Capital Area Food Bank{color}{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n *{color:#4E8227} *P.*{color}*{color:#4E8227} 571.390.9875 |  *F.* 703.541.0179{color}{color:#4E8227}{color} \n\n[{color:#0563C1}dharmon@capitalareafoodbank.org{color}|mailto:dharmon@capitalareafoodbank.org] \n\n{color:#3A7C22}4900 Puerto Rico Ave, NE Washington DC 20017{color}{color:#4E8227}{color}{color:windowtext}{color} \n\n  \n\n!image002.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://www.facebook.com/CapitalAreaFoodBank]>{color:windowtext}{color}!image003.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://www.linkedin.com/company/capitalareafoodbank]>{color:windowtext}{color} !image004.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://twitter.com/foodbankmetrodc]>{color:windowtext}{color} !image005.png|thumbnail!{color:windowtext}{color} <[https://www.instagram.com/capitalareafoodbank/]> \n\n  \n\n{color:red}Please email all customer service questions or concerns to{color} [{color:red} {color}{color:red} *partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org*{color}{color:red} {color}|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org]{color:red} so that one of my colleagues or I can assist you promptly.

Good afternoon, Partners,

We hope you are all doing well. As many of you may know, snowy weather conditions are expected today. The latest forecast indicates that snow will likely begin this afternoon, so we currently plan for all orders scheduled for Tuesday, February 11th, to proceed as originally scheduled.

The most significant weather impact is anticipated on Wednesday, February 12th. As a result, we will be rescheduling or canceling orders for that day in preparation. We encourage partners with orders scheduled for Wednesday to proactively reach out to us at [partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org] or 202-644-9845 to discuss potential rescheduling. This will help us manage any challenges related to the expected snowfall.  *Please note that delivery dates for Wednesday orders have temporarily been changed to February 28th until we can confirm new delivery dates with each partner.*

For partners with orders scheduled for the rest of the week, including Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, we appreciate your communication regarding any plans to delay or cancel your orders. Effective communication is crucial for prioritizing the safety of both our team and yours. Together, we can navigate this snowy weather safely and efficiently.

We will keep you updated on any final decisions made by our Operations and Leadership Teams regarding delays or closures.

Thank you for your understanding and partnership. If you have any questions or concerns, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.

When our guys returned from picking up our order from the Lorton warehouse this morning (Order #SO177250), we discovered that several items were missing from the order. I am guessing one pallet was forgotten.

 

The following items were not received:

 

300015 Macaroni and Cheese (4 cases)

300247 Vegetable Oil (29 Cases)

300256 Corn Flour (5 cases)

 

Could you please see if that pallet can be located? 

 

Thanks so much!

Did you communicate these errors to CAFB Partner Support on 12/3/2024? If not, I recommend doing so in the future at the time when you figure out any errors with an order. The Parter Support team members are wizards and can fix almost anything related to PartnerLink or deliveries! I am CCing them on this email to start a help ticket for [SO186461|https://229676.app.netsuite.com/app/accounting/transactions/salesord.nl?id=8365563].  

  

As I understand it, you have been overcharged for several items because you didnâ€™t actually receive the number of cases reflected on the Sales Order (Spaghetti, black beans, milk). [@Partner Support|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org] could you all please process a refund for these items?  

  

Regarding the  +extra+ cases delivered, I am not an expert on what to do, so Iâ€™ll let Partner Support weigh in.  

  

Thank you!

Good morning Augusta,   

    

The tables below show the errors in December's delivery. You can also see the delivery ticket attached where I made note of the actual number of boxes received of items we ordered, as well as extra items we received.    

    

We assume that there was just a mix-up of the pallets upon unloading of the truck.

Our Return Policy, which is covered in our SMART Shopping Training, informs partners that any order discrepancies must be reported immediately. We provide partners with 24 hours for perishable items and 72 hours for non-perishable items to notify us about returns, exchanges, or any issues with their orders. We also encourage all partners to thoroughly review their orders upon delivery or pickup, so they can inform us about any discrepancies as soon as possible. I understand that circumstances, such as delivery day events, holidays, and our holiday and snow closures, can sometimes disrupt this process which can acount in the delay in notification.\n\nUnfortunately, since the items you did not order have already been distributed and we are now beyond the timeframe for reporting discrepancies, the original account balance you paid for the order remains unchanged.

I hope this message finds you well. I am excited to announce the Children of Mine Youth Center has welcomed Nicole Lloyd as our new Community Outreach and Food Distribution Coordinator. 


To ensure Nicole can effectively contribute to our programs, it is vital that she undergoes training with the Food Bank. This training will equip her with the necessary knowledge and resources to assist in our food distribution and community outreach program.


Could you please add Nicole to the schedule for the next available training session? 


Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information. Your assistance in this process is greatly appreciated.
I've added this message to our organization's letterhead. See attachment.

Have a wonderful week!

Thank you for reaching out about these issues with your order. Iâ€™m adding [@Partner Support|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org] on this email so that they can decide how best to proceed.  

  

Donâ€™t ever hesitate to reach out about incorrect orders, even if itâ€™s just a minor mistake. We want to be sure our inventory is always correct, so it helps to have partners let us know when weâ€™ve made a mistake.  

  

Thanks,

{color:#172B4D}Hello Joanna,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   

    

{color:#172B4D}I just came back from vacation yesterday and was looking over our inventory to compose our guidelines for this week and noticed that the chicken that we received on Friday was not the TEFAP chicken that we had ordered for pick up on 11/08.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}    

    

{color:#172B4D}It's on our team for not checking properly the case size and weight but the chicken which we received was the following:{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}    

    

{color:#172B4D}300595 Chicken Leg Quarters, Halal 5# Chicken Leg Quarters, Halal 5# 6/5 lbs Bag{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}    

    

{color:#172B4D}We received 9 cases of the above chicken. I knew it wasn't correct based on the count and the fact that it was halal. I believe this is a purchase item through the CAFB website and wanted to check with you and the team to see how you would like to proceed.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}    

    

{color:#172B4D}As a side note, on a past order we received 6 cases of TEFAP red kidney beans instead we had ordered 6 cases of TEFAP pears which was a minor problem and explained the importance of checking the order with our team prior to accepting.{color}

We received a delivery of food on Tuesday, February 18. Everything was fine except for one case of peaches. 17 cans out of 24 in the case were damaged. I have pictures below. The cans with the black spots are holes where the juice leaked out. The two cans on paper had leaked and were stuck to the paper. You can see all the cans that were wet. We cannot give out food that is stained like this; plus, we have no way of knowing if the contents are bad. We could use only 7 cans from this box. Since prices are so much higher now and our money is tighter, we would like a refund. 
  
I have not heard anything about the cans of pears that were damaged a few weeks ago. 
  
Have a good week. Emily

Ideally it would have been earlier but due to the days events I could not get to the task of ordering and therefore was relegated to that time slot. My questions is since we also receive an order from the Mobile Market that day which is normally at 8:00 am is it possible to have both orders on the same truck in the morning versus bringing two trucks to the same location?

Good afternoon Partners, 

If you are receiving this email, it means you have not yet attended one of our mandatory Hours of Operations Trainings. There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. 

Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on  {color:#e03e2d}*September 19th from 9 am to 10 am*.{color} These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback.

Once you fill out the form entirely, a Zoom link with a calendar invite will be sent to your email. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We suggest that this person work closely with the food program and have a deep understanding of operations. 

While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, all partners are expected to attend the live (online) training to meet the requirement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations.

While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, all partners are expected to attend the live (online) training to meet the requirement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations.

Our monthly produce limit for weekly orders was confirmed last week to be 2,000 lbs. We had been alerted in October about the new limit and that our limit might be that amount.

Now that this has been confirmed, can you share whether this 2,000 lb limit is an across-the-board limit for all partners, or does it vary according to some measure such as dollars spent or persons served?

I tried to checkout a couple of times and got the same message. I tried logging out and logging back in. When I logged back in the cart symbol at the top right was in the process of being emptied it was counting down. Which I thought was a good thing because when you actually get to place the order it does that usually. But once it was done counting down there wasn't a new sales order. I didn't check yet but I assume the time slot I had is no longer available for delivery? Do I just have to start all over and pick a different delivery day and time? Will I still need to do it in two orders and provide you with the two sales order numbers so you can change it to the same day and time? We usually use the invoice option when checking out but it wasn't available so we used the debit card. Once someone from your end took a bunch of items out the invoice option was available.

I spoke to our IT Department this morning and wanted to relay some of the information that we discussed. First, the reason that you are unable to invoice your orders is because your agency has a balance over 90 days which means that your invoicing capabilities have been removed. Your agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance is $2,254.84. Until this amount is paid off, we will not be able to invoice any of your orders. Secondly, because we are unable to invoice your orders. We internally cannot place an order for you because we don't have access to your card information. I confirmed with our IT Team that the max number of items that PartnerLink will allow you to check out with is 21. The quantities do not play a factor into this, just the number of items themselves. If you are able to, please check out and place two orders to ensure you get all your items by place two orders that have 21 items. For reference, this is an issue that our IT Team is currently working on fixing so that we do not have to do this continuously. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience. \n\nIf you have questions about this, please feel free to give me a call at 571-390-9875\n\n\""D\"" "", ""comment16"": ""10/03/2023 11:31;qm:65d20c5a-0c84-458e-8ce1-adb90d07460f:ebe91bb9-f5e0-4c27-8dbd-38070113bda7;Am I correct in assuming at this point we can't do this Thursday for a delivery date?{adf}{\""type\"":\""expand\"",\""content\"":[{\""type\"":\""paragraph\"",\""content\"":[{\""type\"":\""text\"",\""text\"":\""Jeff Haynie Bedrock Foundations, Inc. 301-627-1313 Ofc. 301-627-3691 Fax 301-440-3051 Cell\""}]}],\""attrs\"":{\""title\"":\""Signature\""}}{adf}"", ""comment17"": ""10/03/2023 11:54;61536ea272f6970069fc1dbd;This Thursday or Thursday the 12th?

Good afternoon Partners, 

If you are receiving this email, it means you have not yet attended one of our mandatory Hours of Operations Trainings. There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. 

Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on  {color:#e03e2d}*September 19th from 9 am to 10 am*{color}{color:#e03e2d}.{color} These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback. Please note that this training is mandatory. You can use this link to [register |https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=4eNCVd-_qki8SMWEhD1eIsYv8jPOqcdPqqy5Ip3OhsZUN1ZKWjFLWk5EV1NHOUFSSjFLUUtaQ1E3OS4u]your agency. Once you fill out the form entirely, a Zoom link with a calendar invite will be sent to your email. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We suggest that this person work closely with the food program and have a deep understanding of operations. 

While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, all partners are expected to attend the live (online) training to meet the requirement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. 

Thank you,

Good morning, Partners, 


We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. 

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations.  *We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it.*  Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( *5 pm*) on  *January 7th*, or the order will be canceled on our end. 


Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further!
We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time. Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this situation together. We are working quickly to get back on schedule. 


Warm regards,

Dear Partners, 

  

We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to you today because we have discovered a system error that mistakenly marked Tuesday, May 28th as Memorial Day instead of Monday, May 27th. As a result, some of you were able to place an order for that day. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.  

  

Please be advised that on the actual day of Memorial Day - Monday, May 27th - Capital Area Food Bank will be closed. Because of this, we will need to move the day of your delivery to ensure that you receive your order on a different day that works with your schedule.  

  

In order to make this change as quickly as possible, please respond to this message at your earliest convenience with the most convenient day for your delivery. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. 

  

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. 

  

Sincerely,

After reviewing the records, we received an order on September 27, 2024, and only received a copy of the delivery sheet page one. However, on the page it is note as page one of two. We did not observe a page two. We would like a copy of page two for our inventory records. IF it is possible an emailed copy would be helpful. 

Also, the delivery reports for September 27, 2024, and October 25, 2024, document the delivery of item 540184 (VA-TEFAP Canned, Beef Stew 24oz 24.24oz Case. Both deliveries were not cans of beef stew but beef stew pouches (item 540073). Our inquiry is for having the correct item numbers and product listed on our inventory reports. 

If you can respond to this email message with a copy of the page two delivery document for the delivery September 27, 224 and share instructions for coding the inventory reports regarding the Beef stew (cans versus pouches) for the months of September and October, it would be appreciated.

We are from Ebenezer Church of God and when placing our orders ever since the change to the app with the pounds reduction we had difficulties with viewing and placing orders. The order screen continues to Flicker all the time as we try to make selections to add to our cart.

We're asking your IT department to please assist and look at it .

Lucy Paredes was at our center yesterday to do a site visit and we also showed her what is does.

Thanks very much and Have a Bless and Merry Christmas

As we increase the donated products on our menu, I want to make sure that all partners are aware that Capital Area Food Bank accepts donations with items past their best by and sell by dates.\n\nThe best by date is an indicator of the quality of a product but is not a safety date. The sell by date is for inventory management and tells the store for how long to display the product for sale. The product can still be consumed after this date. It's important to note that many of our donated products will be past these dates, but they are not expired and are still safe for consumption.\n\nWe have food coding guides that partners can print and reference during distributions. When available, they can be ordered in English and Spanish from our Nutrition Education Department. The dates on some products may cause concerns for partners and their clients, but we urge you all to differentiate between the different dates on products, use the food coding guide as a reference, and also use your best judgment as well as your food safety knowledge. If you have a product that is not of the right consistency, has an odor, or you believe to be not okay, please let us know and discard the item immediately. As we increase our donations, we may encounter some challenges, but please work with us and continue to provide us with feedback.\n\nAdditionally, if you ever have an issue with fresh produce, please include photos of the items so that we can forward them to our Operations and Food Resourcing Departments for their knowledge.\n\nWe appreciate your partnership with us in this.\n\nFor Nutrition Materials including the Food Coding Guide, please email: [education@capitalareafoodbank.org|mailto:education@capitalareafoodbank.org]\n\n[^Food Coding Guidance.pdf]\n\n\""D\""""}",,0.0

Good Afternoon 
If you don't mind, I have just set up a delivery for Wednesday July !7th in the morning. I went all the way down the order but could not find a way to modify the day of the delivery that I had scheduled initially which is not working for my food pantry manager. Could you move the delivery to Thursday 18th or Friday 19th in the morning please.  
Thank you so much for your help!

FISH of Laurel is so very happy to receive this $6006.85 grant as it has been many years since we have received a grant from CAFB!

I have a question about invoice #194073 (this orderÂ #SO192982 was received on 2/13; it was originally scheduled for delivery on 2/10, but there was a problem that day and the driver failed to arrive during the 8:00-10:00 AM delivery window).

On 2/14, we received the following email:

{color:#ff5630}Dear FISH of Laurel, Inc.,{color}

{color:#ff5630}We are delighted to inform you that your organization has been awardedÂ grantÂ funding to support your efforts in addressing food security in our community.Â {color}{color:#ff5630}*$6,006.85*{color}{color:#ff5630}Â has been awarded to your organization under the new food creditÂ grantÂ â€“Â FY25 Maryland DHSÂ and the funds were made available in your account onÂ Monday,Â February 10th, 2025. Partner food credits can be used by your organization toÂ purchaseÂ grantÂ eligible items using CAFBâ€™s Partner Link Menu.Â Â {color}

{color:#ff5630}Your partner food creditÂ grantÂ deadline is May 15th, 2025. Please remember that the food creditÂ grantÂ deadline is applied to the delivery or pick up scheduled date, not the date you placed the order. CAFB reserves the right to change deadlines and to reallocate and/or extendÂ grantÂ deadlines based on partner usage to ensure contract requirements are being met. If your organization cannot use the fullÂ grantÂ amount before the deadline, please tell us as soon as possible.Â Â Â Â Â {color}{color:#fff0b3}Â {color}

Are you able to apply the grant to this order? I believe that a number of items on this order are grant designated.

Thanks.

Thanks, Lauren   

If it's the same one I got from Zaynab (spelling??) Then I haven't been getting them.    

    

The only mobile distribution request was from you when we met. Nothing before that. It most likely went to Carrie.    

    

Erin, I look forward to hearing from you.   

    

Thanks,   

Eric

Hi Lauren,   

I'm returning from the holidays and the snow . We are in transition and as you may know Carrie is no longer with FLCC/Crowder Owens Food Bank. As I work my way through a lot of backend stuff I now have access to. I also need access to the portal to place orders, do reports etc., . Can you assist me with that?   

    

Thanks,   

Eric

Hi Alanna - It was good to see you today. As Donna mentioned, our agency contact info is changing. Donna and I will continue to be the day-to-day contacts and need to receive copies of any and all communications from CAFB to ensure you get any necessary response from Floris.  

  
Shell Lewis, the Director of Serve Ministries, will vacate her role next week. The position had not yet been filled.  
  
Allan Ballenger has retired as the Executive Director. As of yesterday, Barbara Miner (bminer@florisumc.org) is now our Executive Pastor. Though she will probably be the one who signs the partner agreement, she has no involvement in the day to day operation of our food distribution program and would prefer not to receive routine emails from CAFB.  
  
If you need us to complete a form, please let me know.  
  
Thanks!

Thank you for reaching out. If the order could be rescheduled to a time later this week that would be great. We are having a pantry this Saturday and we are running low on oil, produce and meats as this is part of the order. Iâ€™m actually out of town this his week so could you please reach out to Christian Pfeffer-Kleemann, his number is +1 (507) 316-4048. I also included him in the distribution list of this email. 

If there is no option to reschedule for this week, can you please reschedule the order to January 24th 10 a.m.? In this case please remove the produce from the order if you canâ€™t hold it safely at the food bank. 

Thank you for your support of our community 
Dominic

Some items that were ordered on SO157319 were not given to Food For All at CAFB today. We were not given the expected frozen pallet which should have contained pulled pork, pork loin roast and wild blueberries. And we did not receive the order of eggs.

We just got a report from a Virginia partner, Food For Others, that masa flour they received from us on 8/6 had weevils in it. Please see order details below: 
* SO#: SO170804
* Item Code: 300256 Corn Flour, Masa Harina Minsa
 

  

  

Have we received this report from other VA partners? Can we check the remaining supply we have to ensure it is weevil free?  

  

Thank you!  

  

Best,

Hi Riley,  

  

I hate to bother you with such a pesky problem but the Maseca we purchased on 8/6/2024 has a weevil infestation. I wanted you to be aware but I also want to make sure the remaining Maseca on the menu is pest free. We will need to replace our stock, should I find another source temporarily?

Good morning, Partners, 


We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. 

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations.  *We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it.*  Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( *5 pm*) on  *January 7th*, or the order will be canceled on our end. 


Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further!
We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time. Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this situation together. We are working quickly to get back on schedule. 


Warm regards,

Gaithersburg HELP is an all-volunteer organization that has been serving the needy in our local community for 56 years, and we are dedicated to supporting as many families with food each month as we can. In fact, last month HELP served 500 families at our pantry in the Festival Shopping Center. We have only a couple of volunteer drivers who can deliver food, and we must reserve that service for those individuals who live alone or have a partner who also can't drive to the pantry. You had asked for us to deliver food to a family of 9 people. As you must know from your previous food pickups, which total 30 since 2018, we pack according to family size; so a family of 9 would receive at least 8 heavy bags of groceries. We simply can't ask a volunteer, all of whom tend to be over 60 years of age, to pick up and deliver many bags of groceries; and that would not be appropriate when there are able-bodied family members in residence. As an all-volunteer organization, we strive to serve as many families as possible; but we can sustain our operation only if almost all of our families pick up at the pantry. If a client needs to come to the pantry via bus, we offer bus tokens so that transportation to and from the pantry is free. 

It is not an insult to let someone know that we have limited capabilities for food delivery. It's just a fact. And we would not ask to see proof of disability. We explain our limited delivery ability to any client who asks about delivery. Also, our coordinators always provide information about how to get food from Manna and/or the Gaithersburg Hope Center. Clients can get food from us while also getting food from those other organizations. In that way, we hope clients find they have more money to apply toward rent or utility bills. Our yearly client survey results validate that outcome and that our volunteers treat clients with dignity and promptness. 

We could serve your family very quickly with food if someone could drive to the pantry or come via bus.

Dear Capital Area Food Bank Support Team,



My name is Yvette Jackson, and I am writing to report an issue I experienced with food assistance delivery from Gaithersburg HELP.

On Monday at 9:36 a.m., I called to apply for food assistance delivery, but my request was refused based on the number of people in my household and our ages. Specifically, this refusal has caused significant inconveniences and insult to my family and me, as we urgently need food assistance. Insulting my family by indicating ""With such a large family someone should be able to take the bus here for pick up!"" shows a lack of empathy and compassion. After making a complaint, I received a response at 12:54 p.m. today, indicating that the refusal and statement were correct due to the volunteer nature of the service and their inability to deliver help to a large household. I was directed to seek assistance from other sources such as Manna Food.

I believe there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding our eligibility for this service. Attached to this email, you will find documentation of my disability for your review. Please note the MetroAccess document on line 16, which indicates that my disability prevents me from independently using the accessible Metrobus and Metrorail system for all trips. I am unable to walk due to L spine disease with a risk of falls, panic attacks, anxiety, and non-tolerance to crowds. At this point, I feel my disability, age, and household circumstances are severely limiting my access to essential help.

I would appreciate your assistance in reviewing this matter and providing any necessary support to ensure that my household can receive the food assistance we need as it appears Gaithersburg Help is not completely meeting the needs of the community. I value your prompt attention to this issue and look forward to your response.

I have a question on items from two previous orders 
From SO161546 (6/7/24):
We ordered salad dressing 111043. The items had assorted dates that had best by dates past 6 months or more. Are they OK since the majority of them are cream based?

!IMG_20240617_083143.jpg|thumbnail!


From SO163161 (6/14/24):

I had asked for best by dates for items but the dates on the reply email did not match the items we received except for 1. Are the dates sent on the email the best until dates: 100856 - Hot fries, 100854 - Glutino bars, 100858 - Caramel Popcorn? The best by dates are important to us because it tells us how much to order if we want to keep items for future distributions.

Thank you 

Sincerely,
Andrea

I wanted to talk to you about the ticket you submitted. I apologize for the delay. One of my team members brought up your concerns regarding some items you received from us. After discussing your concerns about the salad dressing with my management and the Food Sourcing Team responsible for all the food that comes into the Food Bank, here are some points I wanted to share with you.\n\nRegarding the salad dressing, our Food Resourcing Team does not have a specific recommendation for shelf-stable milk or salad dressing in our Food Coding Guide. We suggest following the USDA's recommendation regarding this product specifically and apologize for not being able to provide further insight. Partners and clients should use their eyes, noses, and, taste buds to determine if a food is spoiled and therefore unsafe to eat. Of course, if a product is showing any signs of spoilage such as rot, mold, foul odor, etc., we will accept a return. I have brought this issue to management's attention, and I agree that our Food Coding Guide needs improvement. I will raise this with our leadership for further review.\n\nIn response to your second point, I acknowledge the importance of best-by dates for our partners and their clients. However, our team faces challenges in obtaining these dates for donated products. One challenge arises during packing events when volunteers check and pack donated items into cases labeled as assorted on the menu. These assorted cases contain items from various donors and are packed without specific best-by date information for each individual product. Another challenge occurs when we receive donated products in different case lots-with different dates, making it difficult to provide accurate best-by dates to our partners. We don't know what case lot your order is going to be pulled from until its pulled the day before or two before its delivered or picked up. Although we practice FIFO (first in, first out) inventory management, the dynamic nature of our inventory makes it challenging to predict best-by dates with certainty.

Is it possible to have the quality checked on item 822096 Kale? The last time we ordered kale, most of the leaves were yellow, over 50% of it. However we were not able to check the item before the driver left. We ended up weeding through the boxes for greener leaves. 

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Andrea

This past Friday, we received 3 produce items that should not have been delivered especially the mustard greens. This is from SO180219.
The the mustard greens was already breaking down and gave off a terrible smell. Both the yellow summer squash and strawberry only 50% usable. The yellow squash looked like it was frozen and then defrosted with some molds. The strawberries were moldy. Both items did not look like they had significant issues from initial inspection. It is only when you start taking them out really looking carefully that you would notice the quality issues. I do not have pictures of the strawberries but I do have pictures of the mustard greens and the yellow summer squash. They are attached below.

Hello,

i just saw that item 100757 was removed from our delivery tomorrow. It is a pallet of meals to go that we were going to offer our clients as back to school choice. We were planning giving at least 2-3 per family. Right now we are going to end up giving 1 per family. It is disappointing. I dropped the other individual cases and decided on a pallet thinking that surely CAFB knows how many full pallets they have of an item since it is large and there are only 15 posted (at least when I initially saw it). It is even more disappointing because every week it seems as though an item is being removed from our order. This week it is a full pallet of meals to go. Last week it was 6 cases of eggs, and 3 weeks ago a bin or corn. 

I thought that when the number of items get posted to Partner Link, these are the number of items available to order. I am trying to understand why the items are missing by the time items get pulled. And it should not be happening almost every week. I have the same pallet ordered for delivery date 8/23. Am I going to assume that item is also gone since the same item is now not available or missing? 

We appreciate what you all do but there is always room for improvement. 

Thank you for your time and help.

Sincerely,
Andrea

Last week I had sent a message asking about a handbook on rules and regulations available online. 
I was told that it is still in progress. We are wondering what are CAFB guidelines regarding volunteers and CAFB food. Do they need to sign up to receive food or is this left up to the individual partners to set these guidelines?

Thank you. 

Have a blessed week,
Andrea

This past Friday the delivery driver told one of our Pastors that he can't wait until 10 am and the pastor had to receive the order. The pastor said he went ahead and received the order because of what the driver told him but was concerned that our full order may not be there because he is unfamiliar with the receiving process. Our delivery window is 10 am-12 pm. I spoke with the driver around 9:30 and I told I will be there a little before 10 but he was gone by the time I arrived. 

Also, is it possible have the best by dates for the items below, additional info, and for pictures for some of them:
100826 Best by date, how many in one case/box
100818 Best by date, how many in a case/box
100837 Best by date
100833 Best by date and picture

Good morning, Partners, 


We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. 

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations.  *We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it.*  Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( *5 pm*) on  *January 7th*, or the order will be canceled on our end. 


Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further!
We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time. Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this situation together. We are working quickly to get back on schedule. 


Warm regards,

Good morning, 
I have not been able to order many of our regular items for several weeks or months and find less and less items being available. These include canned tomatoes and corn, white rice, and different varieties of cereal. This morning I see that deliveries beginning the week of July 29 are not available but have yet to see an announcement. I just want to plan ahead if the move into the new warehouse is happening that week and adjust my order for 7/24 before that window closes. 
Thanks for your assistance, 
Kristine Hesse

We were told that cases of fresh vegetables would be available some time ago. They are never available when we're placing our orders. So, does that mean they are really never going to be available anymore for small sites with no dock availabilty?

We have not been able to pick up fresh vegetables since Covid began and in-house shopping was discontinued.

Your positive response would be appreciated.

I appreciate your inquiry. We offer a variety of fruits and vegetables on our menu throughout the week, but the selection can vary depending on seasonal availability. During the winter months, for example, we typically have fewer options compared to the summer when a wider variety of produce is available. \n\nIn recent weeks, the fruits and vegetables available have primarily included potatoes, apples, and carrots. Due to producelimitations placed on agencies, our Food Resources Team is working to bring in more produce items in case lot instead of large bins and full pallets, but this remains an ongoing challenge. Currently, all produce items must be ordered through PartnerLink, as there are no plans to reopen the agency mart for direct pickups.\n\nI have two suggestions to enhance your experience in this situation. First, you can place orders up to 10 days in advance of your scheduled pickup and delivery date. I recommend placing your order as soon as the calendar opens and frequently checking PartnerLink for available produce. You can edit and add to your order until it locks for fulfillment, which is three business days prior to the shipment date. This flexibility allows you to include any additional items you may find during that 10-day window.\n\nAnother option is to explore our TEFAP program, a government-subsidized initiative through which participating partners can access additional items to supplement their regular orders. Please note that this program has specific requirements and is managed by the TEFAP team. For more information, you can reach out to Zaynab, the DC TEFAP coordinator: [zkadhem@capitalareafoodbank.org|mailto:zkadhem@capitalareafoodbank.org]\n\nThank you!\n\nBest regards,  \n\""D\""""}",,0.0

I donâ€™t know if this is an issue only for our organization.  Alanna had offered that perhaps the problem is caused by the credit card listed in the database for us (although not used for the order).  

It is very helpful to review the menu while an order is pending to be able to add any needed items that were not on the menu at the time of placing the order.

I request attention to this problem so that we may again have the ability to edit our pending orders as needed.

Your assistance on this matter is greatly appreciated!

Good afternoon Partners, 

If you are receiving this email, it means you have not yet attended one of our mandatory Hours of Operations Trainings. There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. 

Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on  {color:#e03e2d}*September 19th from 9 am to 10 am*{color}{color:#e03e2d}.{color} These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback. Please note that this training is mandatory. You can use this link to [register |https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=4eNCVd-_qki8SMWEhD1eIsYv8jPOqcdPqqy5Ip3OhsZUN1ZKWjFLWk5EV1NHOUFSSjFLUUtaQ1E3OS4u]your agency. Once you fill out the form entirely, a Zoom link with a calendar invite will be sent to your email. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We suggest that this person work closely with the food program and have a deep understanding of operations. 

While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, all partners are expected to attend the live (online) training to meet the requirement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. 

Thank you,

Yes, our Food Resources team, which is responsible for procuring food, including produce items at the Food Bank, was very much involved in the conversation and collaboration regarding the produce limits. One of their initiatives is to start procuring cases for our smaller agencies that have produce limits under 2,000 lbs.\n\nI also want to remind you that if you see a pallet of, for example, 2,000 lbs, the system will allow you to order over your limit.

Thank you! For any of your direct distribution programs, like the family markets, do you do any notifications to individuals who received a product that was part of a recall? Thatâ€™s one thing we are trying to determine as part of our process â€“ if we should notify patients.

{color:#172B4D}Hi Kate,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   

    

{color:#172B4D}Thank you for reaching out about this! While the Good Samaritan Law does protect food pantries and food banks from civil liability, we do still monitor the FDA recall announcements to ensure the safety of our clients. Please see CAFB's recall policy below. In addition to this, I am not sure of other healthcare providers who may have a policy in place for this. Gillian may be able to provide support there!{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   

    

{color:#172B4D}Let me know if I can help with anything else!{color}

{color:#172B4D}Food Recall Policy:{color}   

{color:#172B4D}A food recall, as defined by the FDA, involves removing foods from the market that violate the regulations set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Foods are recalled for various reasons, primarily due to contamination or failure to disclose essential allergens on the product label. It's important for food suppliers and distributors to stay informed about recalls, as consuming recalled foods may lead to illness or injury. If a product is recalled, the details will be specific to the item reflecting the brand, product name, freeze-by date, and other relevant information pertaining to that specific product. Items that do not match the description provided in the recall notice are not affected and can be safely consumed. In the event of a recall, it is recommended to return the product to the place of purchase or dispose of it to prevent consumption.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  

  

{color:#172B4D}The Capital Area Food Bank constantly monitors FDA food recall notifications and maintains regular contact with vendors and suppliers. In the event that we are made aware of a recalled inventory item, we will take immediate steps to remove it from all upcoming orders and notify our partners who may have received the item since it was added to our menu. Our Customer Service Team will use various communication channels to promptly inform all partners about the recall and the necessary steps to take with the product.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  

  

{color:#172B4D}If you have received an item from Capital Area Food Bank that you suspect has caused illness, please contact Customer Relations immediately. Provide your contact information, the date and time of the distribution where the food was distributed to clients, a description of the issue with the product, the item number/name, the date you received the product from our warehouse, and any illness or injury resulting from consuming the item. The Customer Relations Team will handle your complaint seriously and alert the relevant teams at Capital Area Food Bank to address the issue promptly.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  

  

{color:#172B4D}If you have any questions about this process, please contact{color} [{color:#172B4D}partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org{color}|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org]{color:#172B4D} or 202-644-9845.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}{color:#4E8227}{color}

Good afternoon! 

  

We are creating an internal process for handling food recalls for our food programs. To inform this process, Iâ€™m hoping to learn from others doing this work. Do you know any healthcare systems/providers that have on-site pantries, and if so, can you connect me?  

  

Also, from what I understand food banks/pantries donâ€™t do any notifications for recalls due to the Good Samaritan law. However, I want to make sure Iâ€™m correct â€“ does CAFB do anything for recalls, i.e. notifying pantries who received affected food?  

  

Thanks, 

Kate

It is then the partners' responsibility to reach out to their clients.\n\nFor DDP, the process is slightly different. I recommend contacting Jessica Arias, one of our managers on the DDP team, to learn more about how they notify their sites and assist those sites in informing their respective clients. \n\nHere is her

The boxes of fresh produce came very damaged towards the bottom and some of the items inside had to be thrown out due to being squished.

Regarding the Produce Boxes, we have contacted your Regional Coordinators, Grace and Augusta, and they will communicate with Coastal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Customer Service Team to address the problem with your produce boxes that were not distributable. Augusta has offered to follow up with them and relay any next steps back to you.\n\nAs for the peanut butter, thank you for providing photos. We appreciate it. The peanut butter in your order, as well as many of our other donated items, have passed their \""best by\"" date. This date indicates when the product will be at its best flavor or quality and is not a safety date. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quality date that encourages consumers to eat food while it is in its prime state. Food that is past this date is not bad and should not be thrown away.

Good morning Ms. Brown,   

    

I hope you're having a great week so far. I will no longer be employed at the International High School at Largo as of July 1st. I would like to give a colleague access to the online ordering system and share the new point of contact with you. Can you let me know what forms are required to change the contact information for the partnership?   

    

While my school works to hire my successor, the point of contact will be the Assistant Principal, Juan Villao. Please let me know what is needed to switch the information and give him and the School Social Worker access to online ordering.   

    

    

    

Regards,

I'd be happy to assist you with your query.\n\nOur system applies grants on a per-line-item basis, which means that only one grant can be applied to each line item. In the case of your order, the line item is $817.00, and the system initially used the last of your FY24 MD Region Moco 1-G grant, which was $75.59. \n\nHowever, as per your request, I have contacted our IT department to apply your FY24 MD Region MOCO 1-I grant to that line item since it is the only grant you have that can cover the entire amount.\n\nPlease note that moving forward, the $75.59 remaining on your 1-G grant and the $18.01 left on your 1-H grant may not cover the entire line item cost. If this happens, it is because our system applies the grants on a per-line-item basis. If you have a line item that costs less than these amounts in future orders, then you will have no remaining balance.\n\nI hope this clarifies the situation.

While I don't have a general answer, there are several factors at play. Firstly, at certain times of the year, we have constraints on our receiving calendar, which leads to fewer inventory trucks due to scheduling conflicts. Currently, we are facing this situation as we were closed for Juneteenth, went through our bi-annual inventory last week, and will also be closed for the July 4th observance next week. Additionally, as we prepare for our move back to home building in the Virginia region, there may be a slight shift in the amount of products as we transition inventory from one location to another. This means we have been and will continue to receive fewer trucks than usual and are trying to schedule loads that fit within this restricted schedule.\n\nMoreover, while donations vary, we are actively working to increase the amount of donated food we receive and make it available through our Partner Direct Program and the menu. This issue will be discussed in an upcoming in-person partner meeting in July, giving partners the opportunity to hear from our leadership and our Food Resourcing Team, who are responsible for sourcing all the food on the menu, both donated and purchased.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nThanks,\n\n\""D\""""}",,0.0

Marian Johns from Koinonia just called the NOVA Main Line to notify us that the person who was supposed to pick up their order today (SO185565) had an emergency and is unable to make it. They are hoping to pick up the order at 8am tomorrow, instead. Is that okay with you all? I can change the appointment in the system if so, but please let me know if anything else is needed.  

  

Thank you!

We attempted to change the delivery date on order #S0191890 which is scheduled for Monday, February 3rd, however, the date was locked today. 


We would like to cancel the Monday delivery date, and instead, we would like to merge that order with order # S0193072 which is scheduled for Tuesday, February 4th. 


We hope that this can also be only one delivery fee. Please let us know if this is possible.

SO194429 - Mice Incident Report ,PART1-8623,82808,[System] Service request,Completed,PART1,Partner Support,Medium,Done,DH,nen.olibngomdeddirn@aunyafjto,udtylaegnjnnedrnbafo.oindimo@,2025-02-20 06:28:00,2025-02-26 04:37:00,,2025-02-25 06:58:00,,"{color:#172B4D}Dear Partner Support,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} Last Friday, 2/14/25, sale order SO194429 was delivered to our location. It included 3 bins of cereal, item 100862. At first sight, we noticed rodent droppings on top of cereal boxes in one of those bins. That bin was not accepted and the delivery driver loaded it back up inside his truck.{color} 
 {color:#172B4D}The other two bins were b{color} {color:#b36ae2}*r*{color}{color:#172B4D}ought upstairs to our storage room. To our surprise, a few minutes later, we saw a mouse coming out of one bin and returning inside that bin.{color} 
{color:#172B4D} We had to act quickly since other food items were stored inside this room. We immediately wrapped both bins, loaded them inside our vehicle and drove to two landfill sites to dispatch the two open bins with donated assorted cereal. Upon dispatching them, our staff saw two mice. This confirmed our fear that more than one mouse had entered inside our building and our storage room through the open bin cereals that we ordered.{color} 
{color:#172B4D} Of course, the issue was not over and the following Monday, 2/17/25, we caught another mouse. We will continue to closely monitor our storage room and other areas to be certain that the problem has been eradicated. Attached are pictures of what was left behind after we removed the two bins out of the storage room.{color} 
{color:#172B4D} This experience was very disturbing, and a solution needs to be implemented quickly. This put us behind schedule by four days due to the intervention that we put in place. We also had to throw away our products that the mice had contaminated.{color}  
{color:#172B4D} CAFB has been such a great partner to us and we are forever grateful for the 'all in' support that you have been providing us to allow us to help our underserved communities. That is why we are sharing this information and our experience to you so this can be further looked at and hopefully avoided. We are in this together to strengthen food security, so we know this kind of issue will be attended to and taken seriously by both parties.{color} 
{color:#172B4D} We look forward to your feedback or resolution around this matter.{color} 
 {color:#b36ae2}{color}
  
{color:#172B4D} Thank you and Best regards,{color}

She is taking this matter very seriously and has scheduled a meeting with her team to ensure we find a prompt and effective resolution. They will be focusing on maintaining cleanliness and ensuring rodent protection in our facilities, as well as inspecting our warehouse products, particularly those in question, to ensure they are removed if necessary.\n\nI want to support you through this situation. Could you please let me know which specific products you needed to be disposed of due to the potential rodent issue, aside from the bins of cereal? I understand how disruptive this can be to your food distribution efforts, and I truly empathize with the challenges it presents in providing safe and healthy food to the community you serve.\n\nI will also reach out to my supervisor to discuss possible compensation for the inconvenience caused by this situation, as we value your partnership and want to make things right.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and once again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m truly sorry for the trouble this has caused.

I wanted to reach out personally to follow up on the recent incident and to express my sincere apologies for any disruption it may have caused you.  I have escalated this matter to our Operations Director, and I want you to know that we have a new leader in Operations who is dedicated to ensuring we serve our partners with the utmost care and precision. She is committed to making improvements and has assured me that we are taking significant steps to prevent such situations from occurring in the future.   Some of the measures we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re implementing include:  1. Continuing our routine pest control efforts. 2. Collaborating with our pest control company, which visited our facility on Monday to conduct additional work beyond our normal maintenance. 3. Strengthening our inspection processes to ensure that all pullers, drivers, and inspectors thoroughly check every order once it's staged. 4. Focusing on the quality of products going out to our partners. 5. Preparing for the warmer months ahead to maintain a rodent-free and clean environment for the food we deliver.  I truly empathize with the impact this situation may have had on your operations, and I want to assure you that we are committed to providing a better service moving forward. Please know that we value your partnership and appreciate your understanding during this time.  As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to waive the delivery fees for both your recent order and your upcoming order on March 3rd.

Dear Partners, 

  

We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to you today because we have discovered a system error that mistakenly marked Tuesday, May 28th as Memorial Day instead of Monday, May 27th. As a result, some of you were able to place an order for that day. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.  

  

Please be advised that on the actual day of Memorial Day - Monday, May 27th - Capital Area Food Bank will be closed. Because of this, we will need to move the day of your delivery to ensure that you receive your order on a different day that works with your schedule.  

  

In order to make this change as quickly as possible, please respond to this message at your earliest convenience with the most convenient day for your delivery. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. 

  

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. 

  

Sincerely,

Good morning Augusta,   

I'm hoping you are well. I needed to make some changes to my order yesterday but unfortunately I forgot that Monday was a holiday and the order was already locked.   

My request,(see below), was denied because the order was already fulfilled.    

Would you please help me in that matter?   

If it is impossible to reduce the amounts of some of the items, then can you remove the only frozen item, 520388 chicken leg quarters {color:#172B4D}, in order SO174321?{color}   

Thank you for your assistance.   

    

Best Regards,

Hi Augusta,   

    

We got a delivery from CAFB this week with various items. There were a few mice openings in our corn meal bags. We just wanted to let you all know and be aware. We were able to keep a majority of the bags, but had to get rid of a few. If there is someone else I should notify, please let me know.   

    

Peace,   

Pastor Samantha

Thanks for reaching out, Iâ€™m so happy to hear everything is going well! I went into your Sales Order and added a bin of corn to ensure youâ€™d get some (produce tends to disappear quickly).  

  

I am looping in our Partner Support team to answer your  *billing questions (in bold below*) â€“ theyâ€™re the experts on all things â€œSales Orderâ€ and I would recommend saving their information for future reference as well. I also attached a contact book for any other questions that might arise that are outside my prevue.

Hi Augusta,   

    

I hope this email finds you well. Things have been going really well for us the last few weeks for our pantry! We made a purchase last week in hopes to add on produce this week. However, this morning when I went to go add on produce *, I got the notice that I cannot edit the order if we paid with a credit card*.  *Could you let me know more about this issue and how we can proceed in the future? Can we only add produce to our order later if we get an invoice?*    

    

We are really hoping to get that bin of corn if possible! Thanks!   

    

Peace,

There are limitations to the capacity we can utilize in the truck.\n\nAt this time, we do not have any other options, but I will inform our Operations Team of your concerns so they can take them into consideration.\n\nThank you,\n\n\""D\"""", ""comment2"": ""11/05/2024 11:12;qm:65d20c5a-0c84-458e-8ce1-adb90d07460f:5ebf50a5-88dc-407f-bd87-560084808b1f;Ok, thank you for getting back to me."", ""comment3"": ""11/05/2024 03:22;61536ea272f6970069fc1dbd;No problem!

We had an order Friday where we only received a partial delivery of what we ordered. We received everything except for the full pallet of pasta we had on our order. It was a 500 box count of the tri-color pasta (penne and rotini I believe). Any help in this situation would be greatly appreciated.

The Get Help Map is a tool that clients use to locate nearby CAFB Partners, so it's essential to have the correct hours displayed. If you were unable to attend the trainings, don't worry. There are alternative options available, such as accessing the resource on PartnerLink under the Partner Resources tab, or signing up for [Customer Relations Office Hours|https://capitalareafoodbank.zoom.us/zbook/partner-support/customer-relations-office-hours] held every Wednesday from 10am-11am. Please note that due to the nature of the training, there are no recordings or slides available, as it involved a live demo and Q&A session. While partners are not being reprimanded for not attending a training, it's important to highlight that starting *October 1st*, partners who have not updated or confirmed their hours will see a banner prompting them to do so before placing an order. You will need to take this action to proceed with making an order. If your hours have not changed, simply verify them by accessing the Agency Overview section after clicking your agency name on PartnerLink. If changes are necessary, please update them accordingly.

Good afternoon Partners, 

If you are receiving this email, it means you have not yet attended one of our mandatory Hours of Operations Trainings. There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. 

Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on  {color:#e03e2d}*September 19th from 9 am to 10 am*{color}{color:#e03e2d}.{color} These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback. Please note that this training is mandatory. You can use this link to [register |https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=4eNCVd-_qki8SMWEhD1eIsYv8jPOqcdPqqy5Ip3OhsZUN1ZKWjFLWk5EV1NHOUFSSjFLUUtaQ1E3OS4u]your agency. Once you fill out the form entirely, a Zoom link with a calendar invite will be sent to your email. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We suggest that this person work closely with the food program and have a deep understanding of operations. 

While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, all partners are expected to attend the live (online) training to meet the requirement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. 

Thank you,

I have attached our Inclement Weather Policy below.\n\n[^Inclement Weather Policy.pdf]\n\nIn the event that it snows, we will wait for information from our leadership, including the Head of Operations, to determine if we will have a formal delay or closure - we do not follow the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions regarding weather. For example, if we announce a 2-hour delay, all delivery and pickup windows will be pushed back accordingly. This means that if you had an 8 AM - 10 AM delivery, it will now be scheduled for 10 AM - 12 PM.\n\nIf we face a complete closure due to the weather, there will be no deliveries or pickups. On such days, the Customer Relations team will be available to reschedule deliveries and reach out to all partners regarding their orders.\n\nAdditionally, please keep in mind that depending on the amount of snow, there may be impacts on the days following the snowfall. If we do have a closure, we will do our best to accommodate our partners' schedules while ensuring that orders are not affected the following day.\n\nI hope this helps!

Hi Erin,  

   

Under our account we had the ability to choose to deliver to the office and at Hughes, however this option is no longer available. Can we add the second delivery option back to our account?   

    

The order SO158079 scheduled for tomorrow needs to be changed to deliver to Hughes - see address below.   

    

10700 Georgia Ave   

Wheaton, MD 20902   

    

Also, please confirm our delivery of produce boxes next week Tuesday from 8am-10am. Thank you!

Lucy that is not a problem as majority of clients eat non halal. The issue is that we donâ€™t have that much space to freeze it at this time. I have ordered chicken also on the menu which is coming 17th. We wonâ€™t be able to handle additional chicken. 

My apologies please remove extra Tefap chicken order that you have added on. Rice and oil are good. 

Many thanks

{color:#172B4D} I appreciate your patience! From the items listed I was able to add the whole frozen chickens, 40 cases and vegetable oil, 50 cases.

Hi,

I placed order S0182189 yesterday for pickup on Friday morning. 

Is it possible to pickup the order later in the day, closer to noon?

As always, thank you so much for your help.

I am looking for guidance on food expiration dates. While I have the one-sheet on food coding, there isnâ€™t really a category for the highly processed items (oreos, triscuts, etc) and juices (non refrigeration ones) that we just received from a donation that are past their expiration date. Can you offer advice on how long past their expiration dates it is OK to distribute these items? 

  

Thanks,
 Julia

When there are gaps, we recommend relying on research and information available online, particularly the USDA website. Furthermore, we advise partners and clients to use their senses (sight, smell, and taste) to determine if a food is spoiled and unsafe to eat.[Food Product Dating | Food Safety and Inspection Service (usda.gov)|https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/food-product-dating]\n\n[Shelf-Stable Food Safety | Food Safety and Inspection Service (usda.gov)|https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/shelf-stable-food]\n\nI have also noted that for our development, I will raise this issue to our leadership.

Hello Joanna. Hope you are well. I thought I did not have a food order for tomorrow and I see we do have. I did one order for 5/16. Which may be too much. Can you add it to the order of 5/21. Or can be talk to see what I need to do. Thanks so much. Best, Matilde

 Hello, 

  

 I am reaching out because VDACS has provided us with  *new TEFAP income guidelines*, to be used immediately. Please print the attached document and begin using it to determine client eligibility. 

  

 If you are using Link2Feed or Service Insights, it will take a few days for the new income guidelines to be updated within those systems. Please print a copy of the new guidelines and refer to them if the system tells you that a client is ineligible based on income. Itâ€™s possible that under the new guidelines, they actually are eligible. If that happens, go ahead and mark the person as eligible, even if the system is suggesting that they are not. This should not be an issue for too long. 

  

 Please let me know if you have any questions! 

  

 Best,
 Joanna

Firstly, they may have food for an immediate order or need to pick up food from another site for the warehouse, which means they cannot have food and pallets on the truck at the same time due to food safety (Pallets are often leftoutside- on the ground, possibly in the rain, and are often dirty) and consideration for our partners. Secondly, our drivers may be on tight schedules and do not have the time for a pallet pickup due to their busy delivery schedules, especially during the busy season.\n\nThere is no reason why a driver could not explain this to you at the time, and I will ensure that this information is communicated to them. I apologize for your experience. \n\nThank you,\n\n\""D\"""", ""comment2"": ""10/01/2024 10:21;61536ea272f6970069fc1dbd;I spoke with the Transportation Supervisor, and she mentioned that she received feedback about the pallets not being stacked properly and having trash around them.

| {color:#172B4D}Good morning partners,{color} | 
| â€Š | 
| {color:#172B4D}We are thrilled to announce that on August 5th, we will be launching a new feature on PartnerLink. This feature will enable partners to update their Hours of Operations for your distributions. This new feature is very exciting because it means that you will be able to update your records whenever necessary. This ensures that we have the most up-to-date information in our internal systems and for clients to utilize. As a reminder, once approved, the information we gather from your updates will be linked to the information provided in our online tool that clients can use to locate food assistance: {color}[{color:#172B4D}Get Help Map.{color}|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]{color:#172B4D}{color} | 
| â€Š | 
| {color:#172B4D}To ensure that all partners understand how to utilize this function, we will host four training sessions: two in August and two in September. These sessions are designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and also provide an opportunity to talk to our team about PartnerLink and provide feedback. Please note that this training is  *+mandatory+*. You can use the links below to register your agency. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we welcome and encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We recommend that this person work closely with the food program and has a deep understanding of operations. While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared,  *all partners are expected to attend the live training to fulfill the requirements*. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations.{color} |

Upon selecting a training date and completing the form, you will receive the corresponding Zoom link via email.{color} | 
| â€Š | 
| {color:#172B4D}We are also excited to announce that the Customer Relations team will be hosting office hours every Wednesday in August and September from 10 am to 11 am starting August 14th. If you have any questions or support needs related to the new PartnerLink feature, this time is available to you.{color} | 
| â€Š | 
| {color:#172B4D}Additionally, this opportunity will allow partners to interact with the Customer Relations Team, ask questions, and receive additional support regarding PartnerLink, menu items, new website features, and more. Please come prepared with questions and examples of issues that you may be experiencing with PartnerLink. Sharing your experiences is valuable, as it could help others facing similar issues. If you have specific recurring issues unique to your organization, we may need to take down your information and set up a one-on-one meeting to address them thoroughly and ensure the office hours are productive for all partners. Please note that if there are no attendees in the first 15 minutes of the office hours, we will cancel that week's session.{color} |

I hope you are doing well! I recently learned that partners are being charged for orders that are mixed TEFAP and non-TEFAP. I double checked with the states, and no cost can be associated with TEFAP, even if there are other items included. Can you please remove the associated charge, and let me know if you have questions or concerns before moving forward.

Thank you for providing this important information; it is definitely something we need to note.\n\nTo give you some background, partners have been charged delivery fees for orders that include a mix of TEFAP products and other donated or purchased items for some time. As stated in our SMART Shopping Policy, orders that contain only TEFAP products do not incur a delivery fee. However, orders that mix TEFAP with purchased or donated products do have a delivery fee associated with them.\n\nI do not have the ability to remove delivery fees from all orders, as these fees are automatically added when partners place their orders. I believe we will need to submit an ERP ticket to stop this charge permanently, as it is an automated process. \n\nTo clarify what the ticket would entail: Are we asking for no delivery fees to be applied to any orders containing any TEFAP items for al regions? Additionally, will we need to issue refunds for past orders that were charged delivery fees due to the mix of TEFAP and other products? I anticipate that partners will inquire about previous orders that included these fees as we proceed with this change and it also may be a good idea to plan for a formal communication to TEFAP partners since this is a change in poliy that we have previously stated to them. \n\nIs there a deadline for when this needs to be implemented? I understand that it should be done as soon as possible, but any changes/refunds to delivery fees are always approved by Austin, who is currently out until January 9th.\n\nThank you for bringing this matter back to our attention again, hope to resolve this as soon as possible! \n\nBest,  \n\""D\"""", ""comment2"": ""01/03/2025 05:19;6064f0ca1613f30068073e90;Hey \""D\"", happy new year and thanks for your response!

We have been a part of the Capital Area Food Bank since 2009, that's 15 years of service. The volunteers that come to work with us do so at the kindness of their heart. Our Community is mult-cultural. People who are afraid of the impact of completing the form. At the Civil Rights meeting, I asked the question of how we can educate the community to help them understand that they wouldn't lose their benefits by completing the form. By saying, you can't have food unless you fill out the form is heartbreaking. 

We are doing what we can, and to constantly be threatened of suspension is not a good feeling. I can't imagine any agency taking such steps over FOOD. These volunteers have worked tirelessly. If you need to come and get the foods we have, please feel free to do so. Let us know the date and time so that someone will be available. I spoke to Cynthia, and she informed me that  *NO TEFAP Food* was distributed in August. I will do the inventory, send you the forms we collected and that is all we can do. 

Best

{color:#172B4D} I thought it would be best to answer on this email thread as you can more easily refer back to the Corrective Action Plan attached to the first email. I appreciate you sending along the pictures of the temperature logs and the civil rights training certificate. The Corrective Action Plan outlines 2 issues, the missing SDI forms and missing inventory reports.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   
  
 {color:#172B4D}The due date of 10/23/2024 was for the signed Corrective Action Plan to be emailed back to me along with a plan to prevent this issue from happening again in the future, please see the last bullet point below each issue, and lastly the missing inventory reports to be submitted. In your case, that is May and August of 2024. Like said in one of the emails below, if{color}{color:#172B4D} you submitted the missing months, you should have received an email with a PDF copy via email. If you could send me that, then it would clear up the missing inventory reports.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} Since I will be out of town tomorrow, Friday 10/25 and Monday 10/28, I will allow for one additional extension. The new date is Wednesday, October 30th, 2024. Please know that if these items are not submitted by end of day on October 30th, there will be a suspension placed on your TEFAP account. Any suspension that I do does not impact your ability to order regular CAFB food.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   
  
{color:#172B4D} To recap the final submission deadline for the signed CAP, summaries, and missing reports are due by End of Day, 5pm, on Wednesday October 30th.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

Good morning, Lucy, I plan to forward the certificate to you tomorrow. Also, the other person that was at the training, took the forms to make the certificates. We would not have been issued the certificate if we weren't there. There should be some accountability also on the facilitators part. I signed the form upon coming into the room.

Good evening Dr. Head,  

  

Below are some clarification points.  

  

Monthly Inventory Reports:   

I have attached what I am able to see on my end as far as submitted reports. If you submitted them, you should have received an email with a PDF copy via email. If you could send me that, then it would clear up the missing inventory reports.  

  

Civil Rights Training:  

I did remember talking with you however I did not see your name on the sign in sheets, see attached document for reference. If you could please let me know which day you attended (I believe it was the last one) then I can send you the PDF copy for you to sign and return.  

  

If you need any further clarification on either of the topics above, we can do a phone call tomorrow or Friday.  

  

Best,  

Lucy

Good afternoon Lucy, I'm not sure I understand. These surveys were completed already. I signed the roster when I came into the training. Also, the certificate is at the Church. You and I spoke at the training when you told me about the corrective action. We will sign the corrective action plan and send it back next week.

TEFAP falls under the rules and regulations of MD DHS, collection of SDI forms is one of the requirements set forth by them not by myself or by CAFB. \n\n  \n\nI completely understand that the work that you and all your volunteers do is hard and exhausting work. We also understand that not everyone is able to, qualifies for, or feels comfortable completing the SDI form. This is why we do always recommend there be non TEFAP food set aside for those do not qualify or are unable to complete the SDI form. \n\n  \n\nMy goal is not to suspend New Hope and Life Church of God, it is to work with you and each partner to ensure there is compliance with regulations set forth by MD DHS, to work together when other problems arise, and to get to know each partner to the best of my ability so that I can continue to advocate for change at the state level. \n\n  \n\nRegarding the monthly inventory report for the month of August, like covered in the civil rights training, regardless of whether food was distributed a report must still be submitted. In the case of no distribution, you would just need to put 0 under the household and individuals served, note any inventory you have at the time, sign and submit. \n\nI can also look at your sales order record and send you the food ordered around that time frame which may help in the completion of the report. \n\n  \n\nI do want to remind you that I am out of town tomorrow Friday October 24th and Monday, October 28th. Like stated in the previous emails, what needs to be submitted on Wednesday, October 23rd is the signed corrective action plan, a summary of how you will be collecting SDI forms, and submission of the monthly inventory reports that have not yet been submitted. Submission of the reports can be through the links originally sent or if your organization completed the reports previously, they should have been sent an email copy of the report which can then be emailed to me. \n\n  \n\nI appreciate your patience, understanding and the work you and you organization does for the community. \n\n  \n\nBest, \n\nLucy \n\n  \n  {color:inherit}\n\n {color}{color:#172B4D}{color}{color:inherit}{color}""}",,0.0

However, while speaking with Charity during the training and relaying that I would like to separate the locations, she told me in stead of selecting my own credentials through the link, CAFB would create them for me using my email address for all but a different password for each.

If you would like to add a different location, I will need to conduct a site visit to ensure food safety and we will need to have a larger conversation around how the food will be distributed between the two sites. I believe when we spoke on the phone previously, we agreed you would begin ordering again for the Kennedy Shelter to see the types of food we have available. I understood then from there we would see if it made sense to add another location or not based on the different needs.

We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to you today because we have discovered a system error that mistakenly marked Tuesday, May 28th as Memorial Day instead of Monday, May 27th. As a result, some of you were able to place an order for that day. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.  

  

Please be advised that on the actual day of Memorial Day - Monday, May 27th - Capital Area Food Bank will be closed. Because of this, we will need to move the day of your delivery to ensure that you receive your order on a different day that works with your schedule.  

  

In order to make this change as quickly as possible, please respond to this message at your earliest convenience with the most convenient day for your delivery. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. 

  

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. 

  

Sincerely,

A few months ago, we were contacted about switching our distribution day from Tuesday to a later day in the week, and we agreed to move it to Wednesday. However, weâ€™ve found that having only one day between our distribution dates has been challenging for our volunteers and has created scheduling conflicts with some of our other pickups.

Now that the holidays are over, weâ€™d like to request switching back to our original Tuesday distribution. This change would allow us to serve the community more effectively and provide our volunteers with adequate time to recover between distributions.

We understand the importance of aligning with your delivery schedule and want to remain considerate of your operations. However, we would greatly appreciate it if this adjustment could be made. Please let us know if this is possible.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Dear Partners, 

  

We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to you today because we have discovered a system error that mistakenly marked Tuesday, May 28th as Memorial Day instead of Monday, May 27th. As a result, some of you were able to place an order for that day. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.  

  

Please be advised that on the actual day of Memorial Day - Monday, May 27th - Capital Area Food Bank will be closed. Because of this, we will need to move the day of your delivery to ensure that you receive your order on a different day that works with your schedule.  

  

In order to make this change as quickly as possible, please respond to this message at your earliest convenience with the most convenient day for your delivery. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. 

  

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. 

  

Sincerely,

We received 1 - 825068 Cantaloupe FULL PALLET 72cs today. Sadly, we have gone through 40+ of the 72 cases (and going through more) 

and the cantaloupe is moldy, and spoiled. We are disappointed that we are not able to give to our clients and this was a very bountiful item. Attached are some images showing the issue. 

As we know we are not able to give out, we are asking and seeing if a truck can come to pick up to dispose. Having nearly 2600 pounds of spoiled food will dramatically take out our resources for disposing. 

Thank you in advance for your quick response to this matter.

- Chris

Iâ€™m looping in [@Partner Support|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org] because theyâ€™re more clued into warehouse closures than I am and should be able to answer your questions thoroughly.  

  

I am currently looking into Coastal produce box delivery capacity during holidays / the limit of the funding we have for those.  

  

Thanks!

Hi Augusta -   

    

Looking at the end of 2024 and wanted to check on delivery dates for planning purposes. 
*  Thanksgiving is Thursday, November 28th -- Will you have deliveries on Wednesday, November 27th?
*  Christmas is Wednesday, December 25th -- Will you have deliveries on Tuesday, December 24th?
*  New Year's Day is Wednesday, January 1st -- Will you have deliveries either Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday of that week?
  

Thanks   

    

- Chris

I just left a message on Augusta's VM and now emailing that we did not receive 1 of our 4 pallets today from Coastal Sunbelt Produce. The driver only had 3 on the truck. The order is for 320 Produce Boxes and we only received 240 Produce Boxes.

Please advise on if we will receive the 4th pallet today.

This tuna is described as packed in water but itâ€™s actually mixed with soy protein. We are getting a lot of complaints about the quality, ranging from â€œitâ€™s disgustingâ€ to being an â€œinsult.â€

I believe a pallet from this order may have been left behind in the warehouse. We received 2 bins watermelon, 1 bin corn, 4 cases Halal chicken leg quarters, 20 boxes Corn Flakes and 5 sacks of lentils. The driver said he had 4 pallets for us, all of which we received.

I just checked again and these are the items that are missing:

5 sacks lentils

6 cases 8-oz milk

1 box assorted green vegetables

10 cases white rice

5 cases dried pinto beans

6 cases tuna

2 cases assorted soup

10 cases red lentil Jambalaya

Good afternoon Partners, 

If you are receiving this email, it means you have not yet attended one of our mandatory Hours of Operations Trainings. There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. 

Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on  {color:#e03e2d}*September 19th from 9 am to 10 am*{color}{color:#e03e2d}.{color} These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback. Please note that this training is mandatory. You can use this link to [register |https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=4eNCVd-_qki8SMWEhD1eIsYv8jPOqcdPqqy5Ip3OhsZUN1ZKWjFLWk5EV1NHOUFSSjFLUUtaQ1E3OS4u]your agency. Once you fill out the form entirely, a Zoom link with a calendar invite will be sent to your email. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We suggest that this person work closely with the food program and have a deep understanding of operations. 

While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, all partners are expected to attend the live (online) training to meet the requirement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. 

Thank you, 

The Customer Relations Team

This is feedback we have received from partners and have conveyed to our Food Resourcing and Inventory Teams for consideration.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you wish to check back during that time and do not see the catfish available, we would be happy to reach out to the TEFAP team to confirm if the shipment is still expected during that period. It seems that in your original order, the product went out of stock. Our inventory is live and operates on a first-come, first-served basis as you know. At times, items may be taken by the time you start the checkout process, resulting in an error message prompting you to update your item quantities based on what's available.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nAdditionally, there may be different lots of items with varying expiration dates. Consequently, you may have two lots of the same product arriving at different times, with one having a later expiration date than the other. Depending on the date of your order, the item may have gone out of stock for the specific case lot you selected, even though there are still some available on the menu. This occurs due to the date you chose for your order.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nWe acknowledge that our inventory system is complex and are striving to make it more user-friendly and accessible for partners to obtain information from the website.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThank you,\nCustomer Relations""}",,0.0

Alanna,  

  

Attached are pictures of insects that were found in the bags of corn flour we ordered to arrive last Monday, September 3, 2024. The volunteers had to clean off all the other bags and had to throw away 20 bags in the fight with the insects that were alive and fighting back. Is there a way for us to get a refund for the bags that we had to throw away? Of course we would prefer not to have cooties in our corn flour order so please keep those to the manufacturer to discard before sending (ha, ha ha). 

  

Thank you for your consideration,  


 Sally

Good morning, partners, 

We are excited to announce that the new PartnerLink feature is now live! This feature will allow partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This new feature is very exciting because it means that you will be able to update your records whenever necessary. This ensures that we have the most up-to-date information in our internal systems and for clients to utilize. As a reminder, once approved, the information we gather from your updates will be linked to the information provided in our online tool that clients can use to locate food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to utilize this function, we planned to host two trainings, two of which have already occurred and  *+two+* more in the month of September. These sessions are designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and also provide an opportunity to talk to our team about PartnerLink and provide feedback. Please note that this training is  *+mandatory+*. You can use the links below to register your agency. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we welcome and encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We recommend that this person work closely with the food program and has a deep understanding of operations. While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared,  *all partners are expected to attend the live training to fulfill the requirement*. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. 

Please [click here|https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=4eNCVd-_qki8SMWEhD1eIsYv8jPOqcdPqqy5Ip3OhsZUN1ZKWjFLWk5EV1NHOUFSSjFLUUtaQ1E3OS4u] to register. Upon selecting a training date and completing the form, you will receive the corresponding Zoom link via email. 

We are also excited to announce that the Customer Relations team will be hosting office hours every Wednesday in August & September from 10 am to 11 am starting August 14th. If you have any questions or support needs related to the new PartnerLink feature, this time is available to you. 

Additionally, this opportunity will allow partners to interact with the Customer Relations Team, ask questions, and receive additional support regarding PartnerLink, menu items, new website features, and more. Please come prepared with questions and examples of issues that you may be experiencing with PartnerLink. Sharing your experiences is valuable, as it could help others facing similar issues. If you have specific recurring issues unique to your organization, we may need to take down your information and set up a one-on-one meeting to address them thoroughly and ensure the office hours are productive for all partners. Please note that if there are no attendees in the first 15 minutes of the office hours, we will cancel that week's session. 

To register for Customer Relations office hours, please click [here|https://capitalareafoodbank.zoom.us/zbook/partner-support/customer-relations-office-hours]. 

We appreciate your ongoing partnership, collaboration, and look forward to seeing you at one of our training sessions or during our office hours. 

Thank you,
